/**
 * The class to which this annotation is applied is immutable.  This means that
 * its state cannot be seen to change by callers, which implies that
 * <ul>
 * <li> all public fields are final, </li>
 * <li> all public final reference fields refer to other immutable objects, and </li>
 * <li> constructors and methods do not publish references to any internal state
 *      which is potentially mutable by the implementation. </li>
 * </ul>
 * Immutable objects may still have internal mutable state for purposes of performance
 * optimization; some state variables may be lazily computed, so long as they are computed
 * from immutable state and that callers cannot tell the difference.
 * <p>
 * Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they may be passed between threads or
 * published without synchronization.
